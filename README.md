# Function-Plotter

## The desktop application is aimed to plot a function in 2-D plane with only one independent variable 'x'

### The operators that can be operated upon are:
* exponentiation(^)
* multiplication(*)
* addition(+)
* subtraction(-)
* division(/)

#### The plotter ensures that the following:
* user input is valid and the input resembles a valid function
* The input boundaries are real numbers and the lower bound is less than upper bound
